## 🚀 Quick Start

This library helps you **declare Roles** via a lightweight DSL, and **enforce them** at runtime or with decorators.

### ✅ 1. Mark a function as quackable

```ts
const greet = quackable("(name: string) => void")((name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
});
```

---

### ✅ 2. Mark a method with the same decorator

```ts
class Greeter {
  @quackable("(name: string) => void")
  greet(name: string) {
    console.log(`Hi, ${name}`);
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. Enforce quack match with expectQuack

```ts
const greet = expectQuack("(name: string) => void")(greetFromArgs);
```

> If the function wasn't decorated, it'll be wrapped with validation.  
> If already decorated but mismatched, it throws.

---

### ✅ 4. Enforce a whole object with expectDuck

```ts
const role = expectDuck({
  greet: "(name: string) => void",
  add: "(x: number, y: number) => number",
})(obj);
```

> Each method will be verified to match the expected Role signature.

## 🎭 Role-First Object Orientation

This project is named after Alan Kay — not because it’s directly affiliated with him, but because we deeply respect his philosophy of **message passing between objects**.  
Our intention is to carry that spirit forward.

Ironically, however, to truly honor that spirit, we believe we must **break free from the habit of treating everything as an object**.

Objects only gain real value when they **aren’t created arbitrarily**.  
An object deserves to exist only when it can **justify its presence** —  
specifically, when it can **fulfill a Role**.

In this regard, we depart from Alan Kay's assertion that “everything is an object.”  
We say instead: **“Everything begins with a Role.”**  
A Role arises first, born from a concrete need.  
Then, and only then, does an object emerge — as a **candidate** that may fulfill that Role.

**Messages are not sent to objects, but to Roles.**  
An object is simply a responder — an implementer of the behavior required by the Role.

## 🧱 Classes Do Not Represent Roles

We often treat classes as mere “bundles of data and methods.”  
But starting with data and then slapping on some methods quickly leads to  
**unprincipled, trash-bin objects**.

Objects are meant to represent **high cohesion**.  
But what defines “right” cohesion has always been ambiguous.  
Now, we propose a clear answer: **the right cohesion comes from the right Role**.

A Role is essentially **a collection of related functions**.  
For example, the role of a `Transaction` might include `play` and `rollback`.  
These functions are grouped not because they share data,  
but because they **share responsibility for the same behavior**.

In this light, cohesion should be driven not by data,  
but by **behavior and responsibility**.

## ⏳ Avoid Bring-Up First Design

If you design objects before you clearly understand the roles they need to fulfill,  
you fall into the trap of **Bring-Up First Design** —  
an accidental architecture shaped by momentum rather than intention.

The most valuable objects and roles  
only become clear **when you wait for genuine needs to emerge**.  
The longer you delay their introduction,  
the sharper and more robust they become.

## 🔍 Class vs Role

| Concept      | Role                                 | Class                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Declared by  | The side that **needs** the behavior | The side that **produces** the object |
| Purpose      | Specify **behavioral expectations**  | Describe **internal structure**       |
| Focus        | “Can you handle this message?”       | “What are you made of?”               |
| Prerequisite | Must satisfy external demand         | Reflects internal design              |

While classes describe objects from the inside out,  
**Roles describe them from the outside in** — from the perspective of **what the world needs**.

## 🧠 Real OOP Is About Behavior, Not Reflection

Real object-oriented programming doesn't ask:

> “What are you made of?”

That's reflection — and it has no place in message-driven design.

Instead, real OOP asks:

> “I need someone who can play this role. Can you handle it?”

Everything should be designed around **behavior and responsibility**,  
not around static structure.
